Zhu Shen,"Institute of Dermatology and Venereology, Sichuan Academy of Medical ",Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital,P100,IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY EXISTS IN THE RECURRENT LESION AND NONRECURRENT SKIN AFTER REMISSION IN PSORIATIC PATIENTS,"Psoriasis usually recurs in previously affected areas, so a pathogenic memory has been proposed, but the nature of such site-specific�recurrent�memory�is�not�completely�known.�Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are non-recirculating memory T cells that persist long-term in epithelial tissues, including the skin. Because they can localize in the skin for many months, we spe-culate that TRM may contribute to recurrent pathology of psoriasis.The aim of the present study is to compare the dif-ferences of quantity proportion and secretion ability of cytokines of the TRM cells between recurrent and nonrecurrent lesions following remission, as well as to explicit the possible survival signal for these TRM cells in psoriatic lesion.RNA-Seq, Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis, real-time PCR,�flow�cytometer�analysis/sorting,�cell�stimulation�assay,�and�western blot were used to explore the immunological memory.Compared with normal skin, there are common shared genes�significantly�upregulated�(2 folds, 0.001) by recurrent and nonrecurrent lesions, including CD69. CD69 mRNA transcrip-tion level in nonrecurrent lesions after remission remains as high as in neighboring recurrent lesions. CD8+CD69+ TRM cells exist in both lesions, and they can secret almost same amount of IL-17A and IL-22 after stimulation. Levels of IL-15, secreted by kerati-nocytes in psoriasis epidermis, in nonrecurrent lesions remain as high as in neighboring recurrent lesions, and recombinant human IL-15 can induce CD69 on TRM cells.Our preliminary study shows that CD8+CD69+ TRM cells persist in clinically resolved psoriatic lesions whether it recurs or not, and they can produce IL-17A and IL-22 with critical effect on psoriatic recurrence and development. Furthermore, we have indicated the IL-15 may play crucial role in the survival of CD8+CD69+ TRM cells in psoriatic lesions.Psoriasis usually recurs in previously affected areas, so a pathogenic memory has been proposed, but the nature of such site-specific�recurrent�memory�is�not�completely�known.�Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are non-recirculating memory T cells that persist long-term in epithelial tissues, including the skin.

Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed an increased expression of MXA (TNFi14, SLE13.3, ANA11.3, ICI16 vs. control6, t-test 0.05), LL37 (TNFi10.8, SLE6, ANA9.7, ICI12 vs. control2, t-test 0.05) and IL-36 (TNFi10.5, SLE13.3, ANA11, ICI7, control0.25, t-test 0.05) in the keratinocytes of SPP patients. There was decreased CD8 T cell migration to the epidermis in SPP compared to control.This is the first study to describe the immune-phenotype of SPP and to extend the phenotype observed in TNFi induced psoriasis to varying clinical scenarios. There was an increased expression of MXA, LL-37 and IL-36 as well as fewer epidermal CD8 T cells than in chronic plaque psoriasis consis-tent with the type-1 IFN pathway of psoriasis pathogenesis. This immune-phenotypic analysis may suggest tailored therapy for this form of psoriasis."

This suggests that physicians caring for patients with PsO may consider assessing for GI symptoms and signs, and monitoring for their progression with treatment of PsO to identify patients potentially at risk for developing IBD. Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis�(PsO)�are�at�increased�risk�of�developing�inflammatory�bowel disease (IBD). A survey was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in PsO patients.An electronic survey was available to U.S. PsO patients with data collected from Jan-Feb. 2017. Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO and healthy controls (HC), with common co-morbidities�allowed�in�both�groups�qualified�for�inclusion�in�the survey. Psoriasis patients were further categorized as those without recent exposure to biologic therapy (PsO-) vs those with recent (within 4 months) biologic exposure (PsO+). GI symptoms and signs, including frequency and severity, were compared across groups. CalproQuest (CPQ) scores, which have recently been pro-posed as a tool to identify patients with elevated fecal calprotectin levels and increased risk for IBD, were also calculated. Patients with�inflammatory�bowel�disease�(IBD),�inflammatory�bowel�syndrome (IBS), or other gastrointestinal (GI) diagnoses with symptoms that overlap with IBD were excluded.Overall, 915 patients with self-reported moderate-severe PsO and 1,411 healthy controls participated. Demographics were generally comparable between groups. GI symptoms and signs were�significantly�more�prevalent�in�the�PsO-�and�PsO+�groups�vs the HC group, respectively: pain- 20.6% and 36.9% vs 10.5%; fullness/bloating- 37.2% and 48.4% vs 25.3%; and diarrhea (16.3% and 29.3% vs 12.2% (all p-values0.002 except diarrhea for PsO- vs HC, 0.023).

As of Nov 27, 2017, 1032 pts (397 SEC vs 635 other Tx) had been enrolled. Mean age (50.5 vs 49.4 years), time since diag-nosis (18.5 vs 16.9 years), duration since symptom onset (20.5 vs 19 years), and race (78.6% vs 83.8% Caucasian) were comparable between groups. The percentage of females was lower in the SEC group (38.0%) vs other Tx (45.5%; 0.037). At baseline, the majority of SEC-treated pts (66.2%) were employed, and 23.7% vs 34.8% vs 34.3% had public vs private vs combined coverage, respectively. There was no difference between cohorts. A higher proportion of SEC pts had a history of PsA (23.2% vs 15.0%; 0.001) or diabetes (18.1% vs 13.4%; 0.072) compared to pts on other Tx. About 87.9% pts with PsA history and 34.1% pts wit-hout had a Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST) score ≥3�at�baseline;�however,�the�diagnosis�of�PsA�in�these�pts�needs�to�be�confirmed.�In�terms�of�prior�PsO�treatments,�52.4%�vs�29.9%�(0.001) of SEC vs other Tx pts had been previously treated with methotrexate, and 50.6% vs 18.0% (0.001) with a biolo-gic. Prior to enrollment, 4.7%, 13.2% and 4.7% pts in the other Tx�group�received�anti-IL-12/23,�anti-TNF-α,�and�anti-IL-17A,�respectively. Pts treated with SEC had a higher historical Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (16.5 vs 14.2; 0.005), baseline PASI (13.6 vs 12.0; 0.001) and Investigator’s Global Assessment score (severe disease [score4]: 25.4% vs 20.1%) at enrollment compared to pts on other Tx. Pts with moderate to severe PsO selected for treat-ment with SEC were more likely to have been previously exposed to another biologic, have comorbid PsA and had more severe skin�disease,�compared�to�pts�treated�with�other�Tx.�A�significant�proportion of PsO pts may have their PsA undiagnosed in routine clinical care.

Dermatologists represent an important referral-base for rheumatologists, accounting for over one-quarter of all new PsA patients. However, there are discrepan-cies between the specialists regarding the timing in which these referrals take place.One objective of the study was to gain further insight into rheumatologist and dermatologist co-management of patients with PsA.An�independent�market�analytics�firm�collaborated�with�US rheumatologists (101) and US dermatologists (101) to conduct analysis of both the PsA and PSO markets. Data were collected�via�an�online�survey�fielded�in�November/December�2017 and included patient demographics, as well as physician demographics, and attitudinal survey responses.Rheumatologists indicate that 51 percent of referrals result from primary care physicians, 28 percent result from a dermato-logist, and 13 percent are self-referred. The majority (73%) of PsA patients under the care of collaborating rheumatologists had previously been diagnosed with PSO prior to PsA. Dermatologists state that one-quarter of their patients with severe PSO also have PsA, with more than one-third of severe PSO patients also being co-managed with a rheumatologist. The majority of rheumatolo-gists�believe�that�dermatologists�refer�patients�at�the�first�sign�of�joint involvement and do not attempt to treat joint pain; however, 31 percent of dermatologists report they do not refer PSO patients to rheumatologists until patients have failed biologics or are not improving on their current systemic regimen, while an additional 35 percent report they refer only severe arthritis/patients with worsening disease. Furthermore, only 35 percent of dermatologists agree that they refer their PSO patients to a rheumatologists at the first�sign�of�joint�involvement. At the time of dermatologist referral, rheumatologists state that two-thirds�of�referred�patients�are�biologic/apremilast�naïve,�with�only 6 percent having controlled PSO and joint pain. However, dermatologists state that 40 percent the patients that they referred to rheumatologists were treated with biologics and 15 percent of said referred patients were treated with apremilast. Indeed, 76 percent of dermatologists agree with the statement, “I” while 57 percent of dermatologists agree  With many patients diagnosed with both PSO and PsA, co-management between dermatologists and rheumatolo-gists is common. While rheumatologists appear to be under the impression that they are receiving the majority of dermatologist-treated�patients�with�PsA�at�the�first�sign�of�joint�involvement,�dermatologists largely report that they are managing and treating PsA patients. Furthermore, most dermatologists believe early ag-gressive use of biologic treatments will mitigate the development and/or progression of joint involvement, implying their willingness to manage their patients with PsA, particularly at early stages.

TNFs are typically used�as�a�first-line�biologic/small�molecule�in�the�treatment�of�psoriasis (PSO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, the adop-tion of agents with alternate mechanisms of action (AMOA) has increased in recent years across indications and the practice of sequential TNF prescribing after an initial TNF is less common. Though�TNFs�are�still�the�preferred�first-line�agent,�there�are�dis-crepancies between specialists on the use of AMOA agents in the second-line setting. This research sought to understand the extent to which AMOA agents are prescribed after an initial TNF, and how this varies across PSO and PsA.An�independent�market�analytics�firm�collaborated�with�US�der-matologists (201) and US rheumatologists (200) to con-duct a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with PSO (950) and PsA (1,008) who had switched from one biologic/apremilast to another agent in the prior 12 weeks. Physicians were able to submit up to 7 patient charts. PSO data was collected in September 2017 and PsA data was collected in April 2017.Analysis of patients recently switched from one biologic/apre-milast to a different brand revealed the majority of patients were treated�with�a�TNF�in�the�first-line�biologic/small�molecule�set-ting, though this varies by indication. Rheumatologists prescribe first-line�TNFs�significantly�more�than�dermatologists.�83%�of�PsA�patients�are�prescribed�TNFs�first-line�compared�to�just�69%�of�PSO�patients.�Furthermore,�rheumatologists�are�significantly�more likely to practice TNF-sequencing than dermatologists. Indeed,�44%�of�PsA�patients�treated�with�a�first-line�TNF�were�prescribed a second TNF, compared to 6% of PSO patients. Ad-ditionally, certain TNF brands have experienced recent declines in�first�line�use,�though�this�varies�by�indication�as�well.�For�rheu-matologists,�use�of�first-line�etanercept�has�declined,�38%�of�PsA�patients were initiated on etanercept at least 24 months prior to the study, compared to just 28% initiated on etanercept within 12 months�of�the�study.�For�dermatologists,�there�were�significantly�more�PSO�patients�initiated�on�etanercept�in�the�first-line�setting�24 months or more prior to the study compared to those initiated within 12 months of the study, (45% vs 31%.)

The average age of patients with skin manifestations PsO was 54.014.2 years (70). The average age of patients with PsA was 49.115.9 years (50). The group of patients with PsA was older than the group PsO patients by age. PASI  10. The quality of life was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire. The results were evaluated: from 0 to 1 score - cutaneous disease does not affect the patient's life, from 2 to 5 scores - the disease has a minor effect on the patient's life, from 6 to 10 scores - the disease has a moderate effect on the patient's life, from 11 to 20 scores - the disease has a very strong effect on the patient's life, from 21 to 30 scores - the disease has an extremely strong effect on the patient's life. Statistical processing of the data was carried out using the Excel analysis package. All 0.05 were considered to�indicate�statistical�significance.120 (100%) patients suffering from PsO were taken for analysis. The duration of PsO was: for more than 15 years - 25 people (35.7%), 10–15 years - 18 people (25.7%); 3–10 years - 15 people (21.4%), 1–3 years - 12 people (17.1%). The duration of PsA was: for more than 15 years – 5 people (10.0%), 10–15 years – 7 people (14.0%); 3–10 years – 20 people (40.0%), 1–3 years – 18 people (36.0%). Heredity was aggravated in 35 (29.1%) out of 120 patients. Comorbidity was presented in 112 (93.3%) out of 120 patients. Gastrointestinal and liver diseases were found in 48 (42.8%) out of 120 patients. Type 2 diabetes was observed in 45 (40.1%) out of 120 patients, cardiovascular diseases - in 100 (89.2%) out of 120 patients, diseases of the nervous system - in 59 (52.6%) out of 120 patients, and diseases of the urinary system - in 20 (17.8%) out of 120 patients.The total score DLQI in the psoriasis group was 15.85.2. The score DLQI in PsO patients was 12.53.4 and in PsA patients was 20.43.7. The total score DLQI in PsO patients with comorbidity was 16.15.3.The�total�score�DLQI�was�significantly�higher�in�patients with PsA compare to PsO patients. This result revealed the existence of an inferior quality of life for the PsO patients with comorbidity disease, compared with pts without comorbidity di-sease. The score of DLQI is affected the development and progress of the psoriasis and comorbidity pathology. Then higher DLQI value, the more it affects experience considerable physical and/or�psychological�discomfort,�difficulties�in�social�and�professional�adaptation,�which�subsequently�cause�significant�distress�and�even�social phobia. All these conditions psoriasis are interrelated by genetic and immunopathogenetic mechanisms. Thus, patients with psoriasis require an integrated approach and dynamic observation by dermatologists and doctors of related specialties."

The stigma provoked by the disease, often lead to the discontinuation of daily activities and social withdrawal. Nevertheless, these effects of psoriasis are seldom recognized and often undertreated.The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of life, anxiety and depression, self-esteem and loneliness in patients with psoriasis.Ninety-eight patients with psoriasis were enrolled in the study. The quality of life, depression and anxiety, loneliness and self-esteem of the patient were assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the UCLA loneliness Scale (UCLA-Version 3) and Rosenberg’s Self-esteem Scale, respectively.The Dermatology Quality of Life Index score among pso-riasis patients was 13.524.58.�They�had�statistically�significantly�higher scores according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale -anxiety subscale (0.031)-compared with healthy volun-teers.�Moreover,�a�statistically�significant�difference�was�found�between the two groups concerning the UCLA-scale (0.032) and RSES-scale (0.0001).

RESULTS FROM AN OBSERVATIONAL PATIENT SURVEY,"A global patient survey was adapted and implemen-ted in Sweden, in order to explore and understand the patients’ view on their disease, as well as the personal and emotional impact of their psoriasis. The focus of the survey was the patient’s perception of the possibility to achieve clear skin, and how having clear skin could affect their quality of life. A publication based on earlier data is under review. The Swedish “Clear about Psoriasis” survey was conduc-ted from June 16 2017 to August 8 2017. Recruitment was made via online panels and patient organizations. Validated methods were used to assess severity of disease and health-related quality of life. The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions, no definition�of�clear�skin�was�given,�and�spontaneous�feelings/per-ceptions�were�reported.�Respondents�(≥18�years�old)�were�required�to have current plaque psoriasis, for which they had received a medical diagnosis and should not have participated in an online survey about psoriasis in the preceding four weeks. The analysis included only patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, defined�as�a�Psoriasis�Area�Severity�Index�(PASI)�score�≥10,�or�a PASI score 5.0–9.9 with plaques in visible and/or in sensitive areas, such as the face and genitals. In total, 54 patient responses were completed and analy-zed. Mean age was 45 years and 80% were female. The average self-assessed PASI score was 16.0, 26% had PASI 5.0–9.9, 74% PASI 10 and 54% reported to have psoriatic arthritis. Current treatment allowed 44% of patients to achieve clear or almost clear skin. Clear or almost clear skin was believed to be achievable by 30% of the patients. Of patients reaching clear or almost clear skin, 71% had talked to their physician about their aim for clear skin. Among patients who have not achieved clear or almost clear skin, 47% had spoken to their physician about their aim. 57% of the�patients�were�satisfied�with�their�current�treatment.�The�most�important reasons for treatment satisfaction were less itching (81%), and the achievement of less pain and soreness (55%). Not achieving clear skin was the major reason for dissatisfaction. Discrimination or humiliation has been experienced by 98%. About 69% have been asked if they are contagious. Relationships were affected and 52% avoided to have sex. Worklife was affected by 65% of the respondents. For 58% of patients it took more than 5 years to get a treatment that resulted in clear or almost clear skin. During the last 6 months, 24% of employed patients had taken at least one day off work due to their disease whilst 5% took more than 14 days.

Radon is a radioactive noble gas evaporating from rocks. It is absorbed through skin or lung epithelium during inha-lation.�Radon�decays�in�the�tissue�under�emission�of�α-particles.�The estimated dose received during a radon therapy is in the order of 1.2 mSv which corresponds to the annual background irradiation�caused�by�radon.�Chronic�inflammatory�diseases�such�as rheumatoid arthritis are treated with radon and pain reduction and improvement of mobility are reported (2). Positive effects are also reported for psoriasis, but sparely documented. However, for�both�diseases�the�mechanisms�underlying�the�clinical�benefit�are unknown.To investigate effects of radon treatment we have established a cellular model for psoriasis which can be used for irradiation�with�α-particles.�The�requirements�in�using�α-particles�are�specific�due�to�their�short�range.Special rings stringed with a 2 µm oxygen plasma treated�boPET�foil�are�used�to�facilitate�α-irradiation�and�growth�of NHEK (normal human epidermal keratinocytes).

Because so little was known about contraction and treatment, psoriasis patients were often separated from the general population for fear of them contaminating others. People with psoriasis – thousands in medieval Europe – were forced to warn others of their arrival by ringing a clapper.It wasn’t until the early 1800’s that psoriasis was determined to be a condition separate from leprosy. In the cultural movement of Renaissance some authors mentioned the diseases psora and lepra in their books. In the 18th century hospitals or dispensaries were opened only for treatment of skin or venereal diseases giving to the physicians the opportunity to study more cases of skin diseases and psoriasis as well, while the end of the 19th century psoriatic micro morphology was already described. In 20th century many authors studied the genetic alteration, and today there is undisputed evidence that the disease is multifactorial.Psoriasis,�as�a�common�disease,�has�a�significant�socio-economic�impact on the individual and on the society. Last decades numerous immunological researches accumulate evidence of presence of alteration of the innate and adaptive immune response in psoriatic patients. This imply a primary disregulation of the immune system and permitts a better understanding and new insight in the pathoge-nesis and as well new possibilities in the management of psoriasis.This article shows a retrospective view of development of our knowledge on psoriasis through history."

Finally, patients reported that disturbed sleep may increase psoriatic signs and symptomsas well as fatigue, cognitive impairment and psychological stress. Overall, patients with PsA expressed a higher burden of sleep disturbance compared to patients with PsO. Preliminary versions of the “PsO Sleepy-Q” and “PsA Sleepy-Q” including 18 and 24 items, respectively, were created. These questionnaires intend to measure the degree of sleep disturbance, the potential causes of sleep disturbance and the impairment related to sleep disturbance.

A PSYCHODERMATOLOGICAL APPROACH," Depression and Psoriasis are associated in up to 60% of the cases, with an increased risk of attempted and com-pleted suicide in patients with severe forms of the disease. Bipolar Disorder is a biological condition that affects between 2 and 5% of the population, being an important cause of disability in the world. In spite of this, Bipolar Disorder is often underdiagnosed as Unipolar Depression, which increases the possibility of prescribing errors, as it occurs when administering only antidepressant agents without accompanying them with mood stabilizers, fostering the appearance of episodes of inverse polarity (SWITCHING) which, in turn, raises the risk of suicide. The “Cytokine Hypothesis” as a cause of depression suggests the association between the immune system and depres-sion through the induction of the indolamine 2, 3- dioxygenase enzyme. The objectives of the poster are:•�To�raise�the�need�for�new�studies�to�confirm�this�hypothesis�as�well as the antidepressant effect of biological agents and their potential ability to cause a shift into mania.

The current literature is lacking of longitudinal and mechanistic studies, as well as comparison studies to explore the magnitude of this relation. Considering both bipolar disorder and psoriasis as a multi-system disorder should help us understand the common phy-siopathology of this comorbidity so as not to see them as separated disorders. Consequently, it is vital to emphasize the importance of the initial psychiatric evaluation for a correct psychiatric/ clinical diagnosis for patients with Psoriasis to be both admitted to a strict control protocol and treated with biological agents."
